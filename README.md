## Tom Stafford's onboarding pages

I am always enthusiastic to hear from potential PhD students. Please get in touch.

A PhD with me will involve using [robust](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021) and [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) methods to address theoretical ideas in cognitive science. Plus  extensive mentoring on all aspects of the scholarly life, conducted in [Sheffield’s best coffee shops](http://www.ourfaveplaces.co.uk/guides/top-3s/top-3-coffee).

Specific projects I am currently seeking students for are [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v9akVLjoYlR01V7SvGjYxUsDP2zCCbdvSXYB1NqoqcQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Two important things to consider before getting in touch are this:

1. Funding. Unless I have advertised a specific project, I am not able to fund PhD students myself, so you need an alternative source of funding (self-funding, government scholarship or other).

2. The idea. It isn't possible to discuss applications for PhD places without seeing a full online application (see below), however I am happy to informally discuss ideas for research projects at any stage. It will be helpful for both of us for you to prepare a short (1-2 page) description of the research you are interested in doing.

If you have funding, and a good idea for a project, the next step is to apply to the University for a PhD place. Submit your documents online via the University of Sheffield site. Start here: [Applying essentials – PhD study](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/phd/apply). Please make clear in your application why you are applying to work with me specifically.

In general I am looking to work with people with strong computational/statistical skills and/or keen insight into experimental design for resolving conceptual issues in cognitive science.
