## Tom Stafford's onboarding pages

If you are interested in applying for a PhD place, please submit your documents online via the University of Sheffield site. Start here: [Applying essentials â€“ PhD study](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/phd/apply). Please make clear in your application why you are applying to work with me specifically.

Two important things to consider before doing this are

1. Funding. Unless I have advertised a specific project, I am not able to fund PhD students myself, so you need an alternative source of funding (self-funding, government scholarship or other).

2. The idea. Although I cannot discuss applications for PhD places without all the documents submitted online (see link above), I am happy to informally discuss ideas for research projects at any stage. Please email.
