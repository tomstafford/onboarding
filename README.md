## Tom Stafford's onboarding pages

I am always enthusiastic to hear from potential PhD students. Please get in touch.

A PhD with me will involve using [robust](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021) and [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) methods to address theoretical ideas in cognitive science. Plus  extensive mentoring on all aspects of the scholarly life, conducted in [Sheffield’s best coffee shops](http://www.ourfaveplaces.co.uk/guides/top-3s/top-3-coffee).

Specific projects I am currently seeking students for are [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v9akVLjoYlR01V7SvGjYxUsDP2zCCbdvSXYB1NqoqcQ/edit?usp=sharing)

If you are interested in applying for a PhD place, please submit your documents online via the University of Sheffield site. Start here: [Applying essentials – PhD study](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/phd/apply). Please make clear in your application why you are applying to work with me specifically.

In general I am looking to work with people with strong computational/statistical skils and/or keen insight into experimental design for resolving conceptual issues in cognitive science.

Two important things to consider before doing this are

1. Funding. Unless I have advertised a specific project, I am not able to fund PhD students myself, so you need an alternative source of funding (self-funding, government scholarship or other).

2. The idea. Although I cannot discuss applications for PhD places without all the documents submitted online (see link above), I am happy to informally discuss ideas for research projects at any stage. Please email.
