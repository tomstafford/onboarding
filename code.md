#CODING

You are aiming to produce reproducible workflows - scripts that automate all steps between raw data and the final data in your papers.

Point and click solutions (spreedsheets, SPSS) are inadequate.

As well as being *reproducible* (by you or other researchers) your work should be *legible* (to Future You, or other researchers) and *scalable* (it should work as well on 400,000 data points as on 40).

You will need help to do this. Therefore you will use Open Source solutions - these are analysis products which have a worldwide community of people using them, and the infrastructure which supports sharing advice and solutions. 

In practice, this means you are going to start by using R and/or Python
