# data challenge

The file [ABdata.csv](ABdata.csv) contains measurements, stored in the 'value' column, from two groups, A and B.

The challenge is to answer the question: which population - A or B - has the highest average on this measure?

Credit is given for additional exploration, visualisation or discussion of the question and/or the data.

Please send me complete answers by the method you think most appropriate.
